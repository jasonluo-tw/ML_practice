## Qlearning practice
- python = 2.7
- The game environment was developed at [UC Berkeley for their AI course](http://ai.berkeley.edu/).
- Implement an agent to play the small grid pacman game. Use Qlearning(Qtable) to train the agent.
- To run the codes...it will train on 2000 times and test on 10 times.
  - python pacman.py -p QLearnAgent -x 2000 -n 2010 -l smallGrid

- The picture below shows the small grid environment.
